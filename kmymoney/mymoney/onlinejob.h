/**
 * @brief Class to share jobs which can be procceded by an online banking plugin
 *
 * This class stores only the status information and a pointer to an @r onlineTask which stores
 * the real data. So onlineJob is similar to an shared pointer.
 *
 * If you know the type of the onlineTask, @r onlineJobTyped is the first choice to use.
 *
 * It is save to use because accesses to pointers (e.g. task() ) throw an execption if onlineJob is null.
 *
 * Online jobs are usually not created directly but over @r onlineJobAdministration::createOnlineJob. This is
 * required to allow loading of onlineTasks at runtime and only if needed.
 *
 * This class was created to help writing stable and reliable code. Before an unsafe structure (= pointer)
 * is accessed it is checked. Exceptions are thrown if the content is unsafe.
 *
 * @see onlineTask
 * @see onlineJobTyped
 * @todo LOW make data implicitly shared
